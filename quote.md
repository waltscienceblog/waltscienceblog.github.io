Quote of the day***## I've always believed fitness is an entry point to help you build that happier, healthier life. When your health is strong, you're capable of taking risks. You'll feel more confident to ask for the promotion. You'll have more energy to be a better mom. You'll feel more deserving of love. - ### Jillian Michaels***<img src="https://www.naturepicoftheday.com//npods/2021/february/low_ceiling_800w.jpg" alt="Nature picture of the day">
